Descriptions: This demo program only implements a minimal version of MGEP, which
is a modified gene expression programming framework designed to evolve
existing metaheuristic algorithms. This code is specially implemented
to evolve differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Please note that results
of the other algorithms such as PSO, ABC, Cuckoo Search and CMAES will be
available  as soon as possible.
